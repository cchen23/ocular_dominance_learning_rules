	abstract = {Recent experimental evidence has shown that application of
 certain neurotrophic factors ({NTs}) to the developing primary visual
 cortex prevents the development of ocular dominance ({OD}) columns. One
 interpretation of this result is that afferents from the lateral
 geniculate nucleus compete for postsynaptic trophic factor in an
 activity-dependent manner. Application of excess trophic factor
 eliminates this competition, thereby preventing {OD} column formation. We
 present a model of {OD} column development, incorporating Hebbian
 synaptic modification and activity-driven competition for {NT}, which
 accounts for both normal {OD} column development as well as the
 prevention of that development when competition is removed. In the
 “control” situation, when available {NT} is below a critical
 amount, {OD} columns form normally. These columns form without weight
 normalization procedures and in the presence of positive inter-eye
 correlations. In the “experimental” case, {OD} column development
 is prevented in a local neighborhood in which excess {NT} has been added.
 Our model proposes a biologically plausible mechanism for competition
 between neural populations that is motivated by several pieces of
 experimental data, thereby accounting for both normal and
 experimentally perturbed conditions.},

	shorttitle = {Hebbian learning of recurrent connections},
	abstract = {We show how a Hopfield network with modifiable recurrent connections undergoing slow Hebbian learning can extract the underlying geometry of an input space. First, we use a slow/fast analysis to derive an averaged system whose dynamics derives from an energy function and therefore always converges to equilibrium points. The equilibria reflect the correlation structure of the inputs, a global object extracted through local recurrent interactions only. Second, we use numerical methods to illustrate how learning extracts the hidden geometrical structure of the inputs. Indeed, multidimensional scaling methods make it possible to project the final connectivity matrix on to a distance matrix in a high-dimensional space, with the neurons labelled by spatial position within this space. The resulting network structure turns out to be roughly convolutional. The residual of the projection defines the non-convolutional part of the connectivity which is minimized in the process. Finally, we show how restricting the dimension of the space where the neurons live gives rise to patterns similar to cortical maps. We motivate this using an energy efficiency argument based on wire length minimization. Finally, we show how this approach leads to the emergence of ocular dominance or orientation columns in primary visual cortex. In addition, we establish that the non-convolutional (or long-range) connectivity is patchy, and is co-aligned in the case of orientation learning.},

	abstract = {Significant recovery from the effects of early unilateral eye closure has been found following a period of reversed deprivation involving forced usage of the deprived eye. A simple period of binocular vision, however, has been reported to be ineffective. We have compared these two recovery conditions (reversed deprivation and binocular vision) in kittens initially deprived to the age of 45 or 60 days, and given seven to eight weeks of recovery. We estimated behavioral recovery by measuring visual acuity through the deprived eye. Kittens deprived to day 45 attained nearly normal grating resolution in their deprived eyes (5–6 cycles/degree), while those deprived to day 60 showed enduring partial acuity deficits (4–5 cycles/degree). Surprisingly, the deprived eye's acuity in kittens given binocular vision during recovery was nearly the same as that possessed by the deprived eyes of reverse-deprived kittens. We estimated physiological recovery from the visual response properties and eye dominance of 359 cortical neurons; all kittens showed shifts in eye dominance from the situation that obtains after a period of deprivation. Reverse-deprived kittens, in agreement with previous reports, showed more pronounced shifts of cortical eye dominance than did binocularly recovered kittens. Nevertheless, significant recovery of both the deprived eye's influence and of the selectivity of its receptive fields was seen in kittens given binocular vision. In no case was there significant recovery of cortical binocular interaction: most neurons were monocularly driven, and were aggregated into ocular dominance columns strongly dominated by one eye or the other. Since both behavioral and electrophysiological measurements suggest considerable recovery of function even in cases where kittens were merely given binocular vision during recovery, we conclude that the two eyes'effectiveness is not solely determined by competitive interaction – significant changes can occur when neither eye has a competitive advantage over the other.},

	abstract = {Sensory experience and learning alter sensory representations in cerebral cortex. The synaptic mechanisms underlying sensory cortical plasticity have long been sought. Recent work indicates that long-term cortical plasticity is a complex, multicomponent process involving multiple synaptic and cellular mechanisms. Sensory use, disuse, and training drive long-term potentiation and depression ({LTP} and {LTD}), homeostatic synaptic plasticity and plasticity of intrinsic excitability, and structural changes including formation, removal, and morphological remodeling of cortical synapses and dendritic spines. Both excitatory and inhibitory circuits are strongly regulated by experience. This review summarizes these findings and proposes that these mechanisms map onto specific functional components of plasticity, which occur in common across the primary somatosensory, visual, and auditory cortices.},
